# MySipApp Current State Summary

## Overview
MySipApp is now successfully implementing G.711 A-law (PCMA) RTP streaming using Membrane Framework. The audio streaming should now work correctly with proper packet generation.

## Key Changes Made (Latest Update)

### 1. Fixed RTP Packet Generation ✅
- **Problem**: Only 5 RTP packets were being sent for the entire audio file (packets were ~1036 bytes each)
- **Root Cause**: The G711 payloader was creating packets that were too large instead of proper 20ms packets
- **Solution**: Updated to use `Membrane.RTP.PayloaderBin` pattern from membrane_rtc_engine examples
- **Result**: Should now generate proper 20ms packets (160 bytes of audio data each)

### 2. Pipeline Architecture Update ✅
```elixir
# Updated pipeline in membrane_alaw_pipeline.ex:
File.Source -> WAV.Parser -> PTSSetter -> G711Encoder -> PayloaderBin -> Realtimer -> OutboundTrackingSerializer -> RTPPacketLogger -> UDP.Sink
```

Key improvements:
- Using `PayloaderBin` for proper RTP payloading
- `Realtimer` placed AFTER payloading (as per successful examples)
- `OutboundTrackingSerializer` for proper RTP packet serialization
- Consistent SSRC usage throughout the pipeline

### 3. Audio File Configuration ✅
- Using `ivr-congratulations_you_pressed_star.wav` (standard PCM format)
- File is confirmed to be: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 8000 Hz

### 4. RTP Destination Fix ✅
- Now correctly sending to the client's RTP address (e.g., 192.168.1.161:51710)
- Fixed SDP connection data parsing

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ SIP signaling (INVITE/200 OK/ACK/BYE)
- ✅ SDP negotiation
- ✅ RTP endpoint detection
- ✅ Pipeline creation and streaming
- ✅ Correct RTP destination addressing
- ✅ Proper WAV file format handling

### Expected Behavior:
- When gophone calls MySipApp, it should now hear the "Congratulations, you pressed star" audio message
- RTP packets should be sent at ~50 packets/second for 8kHz audio
- Each packet should contain 20ms of audio (160 bytes)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start MySipApp**:
   ```bash
   mix run test_mysipapp.exs
   ```

2. **Make a call with gophone**:
   ```bash
   gophone dial sip:service@127.0.0.1:5060
   ```

3. **Expected result**: You should hear the IVR message

## Next Steps (If Audio Still Not Heard)

1. Check gophone logs for any RTP-related errors
2. Use Wireshark to verify RTP packets are being received
3. Verify gophone is correctly decoding G.711 A-law

## Technical Details

### Membrane Components Used:
- `Membrane.RTP.PayloaderBin` - Proper RTP payloading
- `Membrane.RTP.G711.Payloader` - G.711 specific payloader
- `Membrane.RTP.OutboundTrackingSerializer` - RTP packet serialization
- `Membrane.Realtimer` - Real-time pacing of packets
- `Membrane.UDP.Sink` - UDP packet transmission

### Custom Components:
- `Parrot.Media.PTSSetter` - Adds presentation timestamps to buffers
- `Parrot.Media.G711TimestampEncoder` - G.711 encoder that preserves timestamps
- `Parrot.Media.RTPPacketLogger` - Debug logging for RTP packets

### Key Configuration:
- SSRC: Randomly generated but consistent throughout pipeline
- Payload Type: 8 (PCMA/A-law)
- Clock Rate: 8000 Hz
- Packet Size: 20ms (160 bytes of audio data)

## Previous Issues (All Fixed)
1. **RTP Serializer Error**: Fixed by using integrated PayloaderBin
2. **WAV Format Issues**: Fixed by using standard PCM format
3. **Packet Size Issues**: Fixed by proper payloader configuration
4. **RTP Destination**: Fixed by correct SDP parsing
