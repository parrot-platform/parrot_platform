# MySipApp Membrane Integration Status

## Goal
Make MySipApp work with gophone (SIP client) to handle voice calls and play audio files through RTP streaming using Membrane Framework.

## What We're Trying to Accomplish
1. MySipApp receives SIP INVITE from gophone
2. Negotiates audio codec (PCMA/PCMU) via SDP
3. Sends 200 OK response
4. On receiving ACK, starts streaming audio file via RTP to the caller
5. Handles BYE to terminate the call cleanly

## Current Issues

### Issue 1: Missing handle_element_end_of_stream callback
**Problem**: The `MembraneAlawPipeline` only handles end_of_stream for `:udp_sink`, but Membrane sends end_of_stream events for ALL elements in the pipeline.

**Error**:
```
** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Parrot.Media.MembraneAlawPipeline.handle_element_end_of_stream/4
```

**Current code**:
```elixir
def handle_element_end_of_stream(:udp_sink, _pad, _ctx, state) do
  # Only handles udp_sink
end
```

**Fix needed**: Add a catch-all clause to handle all elements.

### Issue 2: Audio files are too short
The welcome.wav file appears to be extremely short (ends immediately), causing the pipeline to crash right after starting. This might be because:
- The converted 16-bit files are corrupted or empty
- The file is actually very short

### Issue 3: RTP Serializer error
**Error**:
```
** (KeyError) key :rtp not found in: %{}
```
This happens in `Membrane.RTP.OutboundTrackingSerializer` when trying to update stats.

## What Has Been Fixed So Far

1. **MediaSession 3-tuple handling**: Fixed to handle `{:ok, supervisor_pid, pipeline_pid}` from `Membrane.Pipeline.start_link/2`
2. **WAV file format**: Converted from WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE (32-bit) to standard PCM (16-bit)
3. **Added generic handle_element_start_of_stream**: Now handles start_of_stream for all elements, not just udp_sink

## Current Call Flow

1. ✅ INVITE received -> 100 Trying sent
2. ✅ SDP negotiation successful (PCMA codec selected)
3. ✅ 200 OK sent with SDP answer
4. ✅ ACK received
5. ✅ Media session started
6. ✅ Membrane pipeline created
7. ❌ Pipeline crashes on end_of_stream (file too short or corrupted)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix handle_element_end_of_stream**: Add generic handler for all elements
2. **Check audio files**: Verify the converted WAV files are valid and have actual audio content
3. **Fix RTP serializer issue**: Might need to update stream format or metadata
4. **Test with longer audio file**: Ensure the audio file has sufficient duration for testing

# Terminal 1 - Start MySipApp
iex -S mix
iex> Code.require_file("examples/simple_uas_app/lib/my_sip_app.ex")
iex> MySipApp.start()

# Terminal 2 - Make call with gophone
gophone dial sip:service@127.0.0.1:5060
